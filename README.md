# Hacktoberfest_Fizzbuzz
[Hacktoberfest FizzBuzz Challenge](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)

This challenge is meant to help developers solve the FizzBuzz challenge in their respective programming language, as well as teach new GitHub users how to make their first Pull Request in honor of Hacktoberfest's 2019 campaign.

# Problem
Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line.
For each multiple of 3, print "Rat" instead of the number.
For each multiple of 5, print "Ghost" instead of the number.
For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "Spider" instead of the number.

Write a solution (or reduce an existing one) so it has as few characters as possible.
